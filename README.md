## UX

### For who 
- This website is created for the dutch hip-hop group "The Chill Oud Posse" and their record label "Dutch Gems Records"

### targeted at
- Worldwide hip-hop fans between their thirties and fifties. As some tracks and much of the written content of the release are in dutch the main fanbase will be from Holland, but the main language will be english, wich is common in this subculture. Leiden is the homebase of the group so we expect most fans to be from there.

### what does the group want to achieve with this website
- Last year the Chill Oud Posse released a 12" vinyl record to celebrate 30 years of music making, as well as to honour a band member that had recently passed away. It was planned from the start to release the music for free after some time of selling the record, as this is a non-profit project and the record was released in a limited edition. Its purpose was to be a collectors item as well as an historic documentation of the beginning of hip hop in Leiden. This website will hold all the contents of the original release in digital form. As an addition the video of the release party, wich was held at Nowas recordstore in Leiden, will be availabe as a youtube stream from the website. 

### What does the record label wish to achieve with this website
- The record label wishes to raise some attention back to the label as the upcoming record (DG003) is about to be released. 
- Sell some more records of this release (DG002)

### Concept
- This will be one long scrollable page, with the feel of multiple pages, sections, selected from the menu, wich is allways visible at the top of the screen. The menu only holds icons only wich will allways be the same, both on desktop as on mobile. The menu will visually scroll the page, so you'll quickly be able to see what more is there and also get a glimpse of the album-art wich is used between the sections. Each section will have arrows to scroll up and down as well as an icon to centralize the section on the screen. As an additon the scrolling will snap to the top of the section when you scroll by mouse or when swiping.
- The website is meant to be as intuitive and practical as possible. The information is mostly in the content provided. 
- The first and last page will hold the front and back cover of the record to imitate the real album. Scrolling down further or clicking an other arrow will take you down to the credits in the footer.
