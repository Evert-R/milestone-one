## UX
This website is for the hip-hop group "The Chill Oud Posse". Who just put out a 12" vinyl record last year to celebrate 30 years of music making, as well as to honour a band member that had recently passed away. This will be the website to download and stream the music digitally. You can also view the video of the release party and see all the artwork that was included in this limited vinyl edition. You can follow links to the recordlabel to buy the actual vinyl record, and to different socialmedia profiles.
