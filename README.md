## UX

### For who 
- This website is created for the dutch hip-hop group "The Chill Oud Posse" and their record label "Dutch Gems Records"

### targeted at
- Worldwide hip-hop fans between their thirties and fifties. As some tracks are in dutch the main fanbase will be from Holland. Leiden is the homebase of the group so we expect most fans to be from there.

### what does the group want to achieve with this website
- Last year the group put out a 12" vinyl record to celebrate 30 years of music making, as well as to honour a band member that had recently passed away. It was planned from the start to release the music for free after some time of selling the record, as this is a non-profit project. This will be the website to download and stream the music digitally. 
- Show the video of the releaseparty at Nowas Record store, in Leiden.

### What does the record label wish to achieve with this website
- The record label wishes to raise some attention back to the label as the upcoming record (DG003) is about to be released. 
- Sell some more records of this release (DG002)
